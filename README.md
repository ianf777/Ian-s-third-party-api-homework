for this assignment we were tasked with developing a webpage that displayed accurately the current day, that allowed user input to be stored locally and displayed in the box where it was entered and to color code the grid where the elements were present based upon the time of day. I unfortunately was only able to get the website itself to work but I was unable to find a means to store the local data as well as to color code the grid based upon the time. The assignment utilized CSS, Jquery/Javascript, and of course HTML.
